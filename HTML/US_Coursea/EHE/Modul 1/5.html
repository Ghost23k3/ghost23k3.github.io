            <b>Passive Attacks:</b>
            <li>Do not tamper with the data and intercepting and monitoring network traffic and data flow on the target network</li>
            <li>Example: Sniffing and eavesdropping (Mithören)</li>
            <li>It is passive, you are not active in, there is no interaction</li>
            <li>Sniffing the traffic with a Laptop / Use an antenna to hear a conversation</li>

            <li>Tamper with the data in transit or disrupt the communication or service between the systems to bypass or break into secured systems</li>
            <li>Examples: DoS, Man-in-the-Middle, session hijacking, and SQL injection</li>
            <li>It is active, there is an interaction</li>

            <li>Examples: Theft of physical device and planting keyloggers, backdoors, and malware</li>
            <b>Distirbution Attacks</b>
            <li>Occur when attackers tamper with hardware of software prior to installation</li>
            <li>Attackers tamper with the hardware or software at its source or in transit</li>
            <li>Example: Preinstalling software (Dell, HP), when we have a contract with them, their employees installed a compromised OS, ...</li>
