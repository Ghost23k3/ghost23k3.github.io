            <b>Cloud Computing Threads</b>
            <li>Cloud Computing is an on-demand delivery of IT capabilities where sensitive data of organizations, and their clients is stored. Flaw in one clientâ€™s application cloud allow attackers to access other client's data.</li>
            <li>On demand services from Cloudproviders</li>
            <b>Advanced Persistent Thread (APT)</b>
            <li>An attack that is focused on stealing information from the victim machine without the user being aware of it</li>
            <b>Viruses and Worms</b>
            <li>The most prevalent networking threat is that we are capable of infecting a network within seconds</li>
            <li>A virus needs a vector, to infect something</li>
            <li>A worm moves independently, you do not need someone's activity</li>
            <b>Ransomware</b>
            <li>Restricts access to the computer system's files and folders and demands an online ransom payment to the malware creator(s) in order to remove the restrictions</li>
            <b>Mobile Threads</b>
            <li>Focus of attackers has shifted to mobile devices due to increased adoption of mobile devices for business and personal purposes and comparatively lesser security controls</li>
            <li>They are a definite vector for attacks</li>
            </br>

            <b><u>Information Security Attack Vectors:</u></b>
                <div class="div_body_subsection">
                    <b>Botnet:</b>
                    <li>A huge network of the compromised systems used by an intruder to perform various network attacks</li>
                    <b>Insider Attack:</b>
                    <li>An attack performed on a corporate network or on a single computer by an entrusted person (insider) who has authorized access to the network</li>
                    <b>Phishing:</b>
                    <li>The practice of sending an illegitimate email falsly claiming to be from a legitimate site in an attempt to acquire a user's personal or account information</li>
                    <b>Web Application Threads:</b>
                    <li>Attackers target web applications to steal credentials, set up phishing site, or acquire private information to threaten the performance of the website and hamper its security</li>
                    <b>IoT Threads:</b>
                    <li>IoT devices include many software applications that are used to access the device remotely</li>
                    <li>Flaws in the IoT device allows attackers access into device remotely and perform various attacks</li>
